# Installation

The Payaza API Client is distributed via Packagist and can be installed using Composer, the standard dependency manager for PHP projects.

## Requirements

Before installing, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="PHP Version" icon="php">
    **PHP 8.1 or higher** is required
  </Card>
  <Card title="Composer" icon="box">
    Composer must be installed on your system
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### System Requirements

- **PHP**: ^8.1
- **Extensions**: JSON support (typically enabled by default)

### Dependencies

The library automatically installs these dependencies:

- `brokeyourbike/http-client` (^1.0) - HTTP client abstraction layer
- `brokeyourbike/resolve-uri` (^1.0) - URI resolution utilities
- `brokeyourbike/http-enums` (^2.0) - HTTP method enumerations
- `brokeyourbike/has-source-model` (^2.0) - Source model tracking
- `brokeyourbike/data-transfer-object` (^0.2.0) - DTO implementation

<Note>
  You'll also need to install a PSR-18 compatible HTTP client. The library works with Guzzle HTTP client, which is the recommended choice.
</Note>

## Install via Composer

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the Package">
    Run the following command in your project directory:

    ```bash
    composer require brokeyourbike/payaza-api-client
    ```

    This will download the library and all required dependencies into your `vendor/` directory.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install HTTP Client">
    If you don't already have Guzzle installed, add it to your project:

    ```bash
    composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle
    ```

    <Tip>
      Guzzle is the most popular PHP HTTP client and is recommended for production use. The library is compatible with any PSR-18 HTTP client.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Installation">
    Check that the package was installed successfully:

    ```bash
    composer show brokeyourbike/payaza-api-client
    ```

    You should see output displaying the package version and details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Autoloading

The library uses PSR-4 autoloading, which Composer handles automatically. Once installed, you can import classes without any additional configuration:

```php
use BrokeYourBike\Payaza\Client;
use BrokeYourBike\Payaza\Interfaces\ConfigInterface;
use BrokeYourBike\Payaza\Interfaces\TransactionInterface;
use BrokeYourBike\Payaza\Enums\TransactionStatusEnum;
use BrokeYourBike\Payaza\Enums\ErrorCodeEnum;
```

<Note>
  Make sure to include Composer's autoloader in your application:
  
  ```php
  require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
  ```
</Note>

## Package Information

<CodeGroup>
```json composer.json
{
  "name": "brokeyourbike/payaza-api-client",
  "description": "Payaza API Client for PHP",
  "type": "library",
  "license": "BSD-3-Clause",
  "version": "0.3.1",
  "require": {
    "php": "^8.1"
  }
}
```

```bash Package Details
Package: brokeyourbike/payaza-api-client
License: BSD-3-Clause
Type: Library
Namespace: BrokeYourBike\\Payaza
```
</CodeGroup>

## Development Installation

If you're contributing to the library or running tests, install with development dependencies:

```bash
composer require --dev brokeyourbike/payaza-api-client
```

This includes additional packages:

- PHPUnit for testing
- Mockery for mocking
- Carbon for date/time handling in tests

## Updating the Package

To update to the latest version:

```bash
composer update brokeyourbike/payaza-api-client
```

To update all dependencies:

```bash
composer update
```

## Version Constraints

You can specify version constraints in your `composer.json`:

<CodeGroup>
```json Exact Version
{
  "require": {
    "brokeyourbike/payaza-api-client": "0.3.1"
  }
}
```

```json Minimum Version
{
  "require": {
    "brokeyourbike/payaza-api-client": "^0.3"
  }
}
```

```json Development Snapshot
{
  "require": {
    "brokeyourbike/payaza-api-client": "dev-main"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Using `dev-main` or other development branches in production is not recommended as they may contain unstable code.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### PHP Version Mismatch

If you encounter an error about PHP version requirements:

```bash
Your PHP version (8.0.x) does not satisfy that requirement.
```

You need to upgrade to PHP 8.1 or higher. Check your version:

```bash
php -v
```

### Memory Limit Issues

If Composer runs out of memory during installation:

```bash
COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1 composer require brokeyourbike/payaza-api-client
```

### Clear Composer Cache

If you experience issues with cached packages:

```bash
composer clear-cache
composer require brokeyourbike/payaza-api-client
```
