## What You Can Build

The Payaza API Client enables you to:

- **Process Payouts**: Send money to Nigerian bank accounts using NUBAN transfers
- **Track Transactions**: Check real-time status of payout transactions
- **Handle Errors**: Leverage built-in enums for response codes and transaction statuses
- **Type Safety**: Benefit from strict typing with interfaces and response objects

</CardGroup>

## Quick Example

Here's a simple example of processing a payout:

```php
use BrokeYourBike\Payaza\Client;
use BrokeYourBike\Payaza\Interfaces\ConfigInterface;
use BrokeYourBike\Payaza\Interfaces\TransactionInterface;

// Initialize the client with your config and HTTP client
$client = new Client($config, $httpClient);

// Process a payout
$response = $client->payout($transaction);

if ($response->response_code === '00') {
    echo "Payout initiated: {$response->transaction_status}";
}

// Check transaction status
$status = $client->payoutStatus($transaction->getReference());
echo "Transaction status: {$status->transaction_status}";
```

<Note>
  This library requires PHP 8.1 or higher and uses modern PHP features including enums, typed properties, and constructor property promotion.
</Note>

## Transaction Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize Client">
    Create a Client instance with your configuration implementing ConfigInterface and a Guzzle HTTP client
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Transaction">
    Prepare a transaction object implementing TransactionInterface with recipient details
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Process Payout">
    Call the `payout()` method to initiate the transfer to the recipient's bank account
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Status">
    Use `payoutStatus()` to track the transaction through various states until completion
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Response Codes

The library includes built-in enums for handling API responses:

| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `00` | OK | Request processed successfully |
| `200` | SUCCESSFUL | Transaction completed |
| `500` | FAILED | Transaction failed |

## Transaction Statuses

Transactions progress through several states:

- **TRANSACTION_INITIATED**: Transaction received and queued for processing
- **ESCROW_SUCCESS**: Amount deducted, awaiting bank confirmation
- **NIP_SUCCESS**: Transaction completed successfully
- **NIP_FAILURE**: Transaction failed
- **NIP_PENDING**: Transaction still processing
- **NIP_REVERSAL_SUCCESS**: Failed transaction reversed and refunded

<Tip>
  Use the `TransactionStatusEnum` and `ErrorCodeEnum` classes for type-safe status checking instead of string comparisons.
